## Local Development Scripts

Open the terminal in VSCode, make sure you are in the project's directory, and run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
It should automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Open another terminal node to run the json-server local api to populate the questions database:

### `npm run server`

It will run a mock api server script in a separate browser window.\
Open a new browser window in [http://localhost:8000/questions](http://localhost:8000/questions) to view the questions.json database.
